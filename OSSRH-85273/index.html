	  <P>The Integrated Alarm System (&brvbar;AS) is a software tool whose main purpose is to get alarms and monitor points from different sources and generate alarms to present to the users who can range from operators in the control room, up to engineers sittings at their desks.
The alarm system is a message passing facility that routes information about abnormal situations detected from hardware or software to the user in an easy to understand format.
The purpose of such tool is to increase the situation awareness of the audience and help understanding the root cause of a chain of problems in order to minimize the reaction time and improve the overall efficiency of the facility.</P>

<P>An alarm system is a basic operator support system for managing abnormal (also called non-nominal) situations and it has the following two functions:
<UL>
        <LI>To warn the operator about a situation that is not normal; alarms must be relevant to the operator’s role at the time, indicate what response is required, be presented at a rate the operator can deal with, and be easy to understand.
        <LI>To serve as an alarm and event log, which can be used for an analysis of incidents and to optimize operations.
</UL>
<P>The alarm system must provide useful information and functionality to support the operators’ tasks.
Information must be presented and handled in a way that is compatible with human capabilities and limitations, so that the alarm system remains usable for the operators in all situations.</p>
